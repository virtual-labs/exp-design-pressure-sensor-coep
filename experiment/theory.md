# Theory:

The most common type of pressure -sensing elastic elements used in a transducer is the diaphragm. The diaphragm is essentially a thin circular plate stretched and fastened at its periphery. Diaphragms are widely used as sensing element for high accuracy and good dynamic response. Sensing diaphragms are made from elastic metal alloys, such as bronze, phosphor bronze, beryllium copper, and stainless steel or from proprietary alloys such as Monel, Inconel-X and Nickel-span-C. 
The deflection phenomena in a diaphragm, on application of pressure is shown in figure.  Both tension and compression stresses exist simultaneously in the diaphragm gauges. This allows the use of a four active arm bridge in which all effectare additive which gives both temperature compensation and large output as well. Since the diaphragm surface is in a state of biaxial stress and both radial and tangential stress contribute to the radial or tangential strain at any point. The generated biaxial strain relation are


∈r=(Sr-νSt)/E


∈t=(St-νSr)/E

Sr=(3PR²  ν[(1/ν+1)-(3/ν+1)(r/R)² ])/(8t²  )

St=(3PR²  ν[(1/ν+1)-(1/ν+3)(r/R)² ])/(8t²  )

Where,
P= Pressure applied
T=Thickness of diaphragm
R= Radius of the diaphragm
r= Position parameter
Sr= Radial stress
St= Tangential Stress

Once the strains are calculated, the change of resistance R of individual gauge is obtained from the gauge factors, then eo can be determined from the bridge circuit sensitivity.εtassumes its maximum value at r=0.  The radial strainεris positive in some region but negative in others and assumes its maximum value at r=R

Flat diaphragm shows nonlinearity at large deflections. This nonlinearity in the stresses follows closely the nonlinearity in the center point deflection yc, of the diaphragm, for which the following relation is available:

P=(16Et^(4 ))/(3R^4 (1-ν))[yc/t  +0.488( yc/t)^3]

A special purpose strain gauge rosette which has been designed to take advantages of this strain distribution, is widely used in diaphragm type pressure transducer. Two strain gauges will be at the center of diaphragm where tangential strain will be maximum. Similarly, two strain gauges are installed at the edge of the diaphragm where radial strain is maximum. 

Strain gauges R2 and R4 areoriented to read the radial strain and placed as close to the edge as possible, since the radial strain has maximum negative value at this point. Strain gauges R1 and R3 are installed as close to the center as possible and it will read tangential strain, since it is maximum at this point.

In Wheatstone bridge tangential elements are in arm R1 and R3 and the radial elements are in arm R2 and R4. So the output voltages Eo for diaphragm sensor using strain gauge rosette supplied by the manufacturer is as

Eo= (0.82PR^2 (1- ν²))/(Et² )


P=(1.22Et^2 Eo)/(R² (1-ν²)Eex) = C Eo

Diaphragm strain gauges rosette installed on backing material are commercially available in several sizes ranging from 0.45cm to 3.2cm. The sensitivity of diaphragm pressure transducer Wheatstone bridge combination is given by 

S=Eo/P= 0.82(R² (1- ν²)Eex)/(Et² )
The relationship between pressure and voltage will be linear to within 0.3% if the deflection yc at the center of the diaphragm is less that t/4. The deflection at the center of the diaphragm can be expressed in terms of pressure as:

yc=(3PR^4 (1- ν²))/(16Et^3 )
With restriction that yc ≤  t/4
Pmax=4/3(〖t/R)^4  E/((1- ν² ))
